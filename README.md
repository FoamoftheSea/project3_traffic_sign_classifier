# Project 3: Traffic Sign Classifier

Project 3 for Udacity Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree. Uses Keras to implement LeNet architecture on a classification task using images of traffic signs, then compare these results to custom architectures.

### Contents:

- Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb - Main project notebook. Walks through dataset loading, exploration, model architecture design, training, testing, and results comparison. The best performing model is then tested on new images obtained from the internet. Finally, feature maps from the network are visualized.

- writeup.md - In-depth writeup for the project, where the processes undertaken to complete each component of the project are described in detail.
